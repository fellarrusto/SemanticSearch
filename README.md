# Semantic Search Application

This is a semantic search application built in Python that allows you to search for relevant information from a collection of PDF documents. The application utilizes an embedding layer to preprocess the PDFs and stores them in a semantic search database for efficient retrieval.

## Features

- Extracts text from PDF documents using `pdf_extractor.py`
- Preprocesses the extracted text and passes it through an embedding layer
- Stores the embeddings in a semantic search database for quick search and retrieval
